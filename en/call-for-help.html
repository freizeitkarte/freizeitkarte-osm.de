      <h3>Become godparent of a map<br /></h3>

      <p>In May of 2011 the first scripts were developed for creating
        different, open map. But it took until September of 2011 until
        the first Freizeitkarte map (Germany) could be published. Other
        maps were following: Austria, Switzerland, France ... all these
        maps are tested intensively by map users before they are being
        published - and we like this to stay that way in the future. <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Are you interested in becoming
        a godparent of a map and support our project? </span><br />
        <br />
        As godparent you would be testing the map of a specific country
        prior to release, you would check for feedback to "your" map in
        the forum, you could propose country specific requests for
        change and put them into action. While doing this you enjoy
        creating something completely different out of a geo-data base
        with it's bits and bytes - something that people use in their
        everyday life - "your" Freizeitkarte map. You don't have to be a
        computer science major, the drive to support is the most
        important requirement. Some help is always possible, to what
        extend you decide yourself ...

      <h3>Improve the data for our maps:<br /></h3>

      <p> Support the OpenStreetMap core data of this map. Through doing
        that you will also improve our Freizeitkarte maps. Missing or
        incorrectly documented map data can be edited on OpeenStreetMap.
        This is easier than you may think. You just have to register with
        OpenStreetMap and try it. Like this other map users can benefit
        from your knowledge. <br />

      <h3>Report errors on the maps:<br /></h3>
        
        <p>Without beeing an expert and without registration you can provide info about missing or wrong data with the <b>Report an error functionality</b>. Please don't forget to have on "your errors" - maybe someone trying to fix it has a question.

        <h3>Missing something?<br /></h3>

      <p>If something works different or looks different (or does not
        work at all) let us know. Only like this we can check the issue
        and may already have fixed it with the next map release.

      <h3><strong>You have derived a specialized map:</strong> </h3>

      <p><strong>Visual representation:</strong><br />
        The visual representation of the map is defined through a so
        called TYP file. You could, with some technical background
        knowledge, change the representation of the map radically. This
        could be because you like "your" design better or you may have
        done changes to better support your GPS device. Share your work
        with other users. 
      </p>

      <p></p><strong>Your own map:</strong><br />
        Using the development environment of the map it "easily" possible
        to derive new or specialized map form the Freizeitkarte maps.
        Share these map with other users.
