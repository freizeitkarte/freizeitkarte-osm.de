      <h3>Support our project financially</h3>

      <p><strong>Obolus for project support:</strong></p>

      <p><img alt="" src="../images/Kaffee-Kuchen.jpg" style="width: 125px; height: 71px; border: 1px solid; float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" /> If the Freizeitkarte project does something good for you maybe you can think about supporting us a little. Don't regard this a commercialization but rather as an invitation to "a cup of tea and cake". Through your donation you are helping us to continue the project. <a href="./imprint.html">How you can donate you find in the imprint</a>.</p>

      <h3>Become godparent of a map<br /></h3>

      <p>In May of 2011 the first scripts were developed for creating different, open map. But it took until September of 2011 until the first Freizeitkarte map (Germany) could be published. Other maps were following: Austria, Switzerland, France ... all these maps are tested intensively by map users before they are being published - and we like this to stay that way in the future.<br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Are you interested in becoming a godparent of a map and support our project?</span><br />
      <br />
      As godparent you would be testing the map of a specific country prior to release, you would check for feedback to "your" map in the forum, you could propose country specific requests for change and put them into action. While doing this you enjoy creating something completely different out of a geo-data base with it's bits and bytes - something that people use in their everyday life - "your" Freizeitkarte map. You don't have to be a computer science major, the drive to support is the most important requirement. Some help is always possible, to what extend you decide yourself ...</p><img alt="" border="1" src="../images/Tiefster-Punkt.jpg" /><br />

      <h3>Improve the data:<br /></h3>

      <p>Improve the OpenStreetMap data which are the of our maps. Doing that you will also improve our Freizeitkarte maps. Missing or incorrectly documented map data can be edited on OpeenStreetMap. This is easier than you may think. You just have to register with OpenStreetMap and try it. Like this other map users can benefit from your knowledge.<br /></p><img border="1" src="../images/id.jpg" /><br />

      <h3>Report errors on the maps:<br /></h3>

      <p>Without beeing an expert and without registration you can provide info about missing or wrong data with the <b>Report an error</b> feature. Please don't forget to have a look on "your errors" - maybe someone trying to fix it has a question.</p>

      <h3>Missing something?<br /></h3>

      <p>If something works different or looks different (or does not work at all) let us know. Only like this we can check the issue and may already have fixed it with the next map release.</p>

      <h3><strong>You have derived a specialized map:</strong></h3>

      <p><strong>Visual representation:</strong><br />
      The visual representation of the map is defined through a so called TYP file. You could, with some technical background knowledge, change the representation of the map radically. This could be because you like "your" design better or you may have done changes to better support your GPS device. Share your work with other users.</p><strong>Your own map:</strong><br />
      Using the development environment of the map it "easily" possible to derive new or specialized map form the Freizeitkarte maps. Share these map with other users.
